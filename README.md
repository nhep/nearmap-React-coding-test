# nearmap-React-coding-test

Build a simple app using React. (Using React Functional Components and React Hooks preferably)
Take a look at mockup.jpg to get a feel for what we're after.

The application should:
- Display background-map.jpg (just display the image, nothing fancy).
- Load the map data from map-data.json.
- Populate the map with markers.
- When the user clicks on a marker, an information box will appear, showing the information for that location.
- When the user clicks on the map, the marker will deselect, and the information box will disappear.

Assume that the app and the data set will grow over time. So the initial architecture needs to take this into account.

Send us back the final app in a zip file with the source code.
We would like to be able run: 'npm install' / 'npm start' in the root of the project and have the app run locally (In the latest Chrome, don't worry about supporting older browsers).

DO NOT send pull requests against this repository for two reasons:
- We don't want executables checked into source control
- We don't want other candidates to see your solution.
